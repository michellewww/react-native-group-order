## Technologies

These are the main technologies that I used. You can check the other dependencies in `package.json`.

1. React Native: A popular JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications.
2. Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building responsive user interfaces.

## Installation

1. Fork the project to your GitHub account
2. Clone the project to your local machine.
3. Navigate to your folder and run `npx expo install`
4. Start the development server: `npx expo start`. This command will launch the Expo development server and provide you with options to run the app on an emulator, physical device, or web browser.
